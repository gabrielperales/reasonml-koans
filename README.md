# Reason Koans

Just some exercises for a beginner who is willing to learn Reasonml.

This is pretty much a WIP, and right now the solutions of the koans are giving with the tests, but I'll try to remove them if I finish all the sections I want to cover.

## Why?

I find difficult to find clear documentation and examples about Reasonml. It looks like Reasonml is changing a lot and the vast majority of the resources I found for learning was done using the old syntax, so I picked some of those koans [bassjacob/reasonml-koans](https://github.com/bassjacob/reasonml-koans), and I updated them to the new syntax.

## Getting Started

Just install dependencies with `npm install`, and then you will be able to run `npm start`. That command will watch all changes done inside the `__tests__` folder, so you can see if all the test are passing or not. Add your tests and do changes to it as a playground for learning Reasonml.
